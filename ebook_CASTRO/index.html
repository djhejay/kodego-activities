                <td><p>Anna Karenina tells of the doomed love affair
                    between the sensuous and rebellious Anna and the 
                    dashing officer, Count Vronsky. Tragedy unfolds 
                    as Anna rejects her passionless marriage and must endure 
                    the hypocrisies of society. Set against a vast and 
                    richly textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, 
                    the novel's seven major characters create a dynamic 
                    imbalance, playing out the contrasts of city and 
                    country life and all the variations on love 
                    and family happiness.</p></td>

                <td><p>For daring to peer into the heart of an adulteress and enumerate 
                    its contents with profound dispassion, the author of Madame Bovary 
                    was tried for "offenses against morality and religion." What shocks 
                    us today about Flaubert's devastatingly realized tale of a young 
                    woman destroyed by the reckless pursuit of her romantic dreams is 
                    its pure artistry: the poise of its narrative structure, the opulence 
                    of its prose (marvelously captured in the English translation of 
                    Francis Steegmuller), and its creation of a world whose minor 
                    figures are as vital as its doomed heroine.
